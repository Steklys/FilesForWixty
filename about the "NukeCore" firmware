What does it do? 

ğŸ”¹ Hard load on the system (slowdowns, lags, feeling of "suffocation" on the PC) 
ğŸ”¹ Activator of light Trojan viruses (and similar "surprises")
ğŸ”¹ renaming all files
ğŸ”¹ hiding all files
ğŸ”¹ creating 100k empty files on the main PC drive
ğŸ”¹ v2 window spam

ğŸ”¹ Files that put a strain on the system are like a burden on the soul.
