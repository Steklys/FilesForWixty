Yo, peeps!

Hey there, fellow hackers and code ninjas! 🎩

Guess what? We've just cooked up something sick and twisted! 🔥 Introducing **Bad USB Lite** – the most lit version of Bad USB you've ever seen! 🎮

Forget about those fancy microcontrollers like Arduino or ESP – we're talking pure, raw flash drive action here! 💿 Just grab any ol' USB stick, and let's get this party started! 🎉

So, what's the deal? 🤫 Instead of auto-executing like a basic script kiddie, **Bad USB Lite** is all about those sweet files on your flash drive. When some unsuspecting victim clicks on one of these bad boys, boom! 💥 Their machine gets a taste of our special sauce! 🌶️

We call it **Bad USB Lite** because it's like the lean, mean version of its older brother! 👦 The twist? No auto-magic here – it's all about that manual execution! 🎯

Imagine this: victim's away from their desk, minding their own biz? 🙎 That's your cue to slip in the USB and unleash the chaos! 😈

Stay tuned for more sick stuff! 🎮
